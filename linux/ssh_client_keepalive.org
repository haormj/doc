配置说明
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
ServerAliveInterval
    Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a message through the
    encrypted channel to request a response from the server.  The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the
    server, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific).  ProtocolKeepAlives and SetupTimeOut are Debian-specific compatibil‐
    ity aliases for this option.
